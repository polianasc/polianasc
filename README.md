# Hi, I'm Poli! 🌟

### About Me

I'm Poliana, but you can call me Poli. Originally from Brazil, I've been navigating life in Germany. Although I love the culture and experiences here, the winters drive me back to Brazil every year for a bit of sunshine.

I'm passionate about staying active and healthy, which led me to become a yoga instructor. I believe in the power of movement and mindfulness, both on the mat and in everyday life. Besides yoga, I'm a huge sports enthusiast and enjoy trying out different activities.
